# 0x10c VM

This is a virtual machine for [0x10c](http://0x10c.com) [16-bit DCPU](0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt) written in [Go](http://golang.org).
The CPU part is done by [kballard](https://github.com/kballard/dcpu16.go/).

This is a complete package - you can build it, and it will run. At this time, it will only run the sample program (Hello world) hardcoded in, but more will come.
